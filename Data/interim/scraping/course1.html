Process of financial Consolidation




5 lectures


01:12:33








The definition of the scope is the first step in the process of the consolidation.
based on the scope, we decide which company to include or exclude in the consolidation process.
in order to define the scope, we need to calculate our voting rights, analyse the relation between the parent and the subsidiary and define the method of consolidation

The full consolidation method is used when the parent is having exclusive control over the subsidiary
This method is based on the combination of the financial accounts of the parent and the subsidiary adding adjustements that consist on eliminating the investment of the parent in the subsidiary and dividing the equity of the subsidiary between the parent and the non controlling interest.
In this session, we also see why do we eliminate intergroup operations and how to do it
