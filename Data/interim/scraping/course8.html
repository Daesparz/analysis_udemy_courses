Just like a tornado or a major storm, the market can be volatile at times, but it also has its calm, sunny days too. These are totally natural occurrences in the cycle of any natural environment. 
 how many traders think the market is out to "get them"? Many have that attitude... and that's why they lose money. 
 When You Discover How to View the Market and read the market like you have never know before.
