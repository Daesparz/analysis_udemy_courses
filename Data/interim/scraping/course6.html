Recent Reviews:Robert M says "Financial modeling made simple.  Being a CFO I've built my fair share of financials models as well, but I can say I never quite felt comfortable with them. They seemed too big, too cumbersome, and it just seemed like there should be a better way. Chris definitely knows what he is doing and couldn't be a better instructor. Finally I feel empowered to build a solid financial model, in less time, and with much better quality. About The Course - What You and I Learn TogetherAs an entrepreneur, you will have many uses for a budget/financial model.
